# NEAT-Game-bot
Game-bot for various games developed using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies

The main idea of the NEAT approach is mentioned in the paper 
http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf.  It mentions the NEAT approach in detail and how it is better than the existing neural evolution approaches. 
We have used the python library for NEAT. The documentation of the library is provided at : http://neat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
